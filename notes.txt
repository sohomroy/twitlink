1) The simple keywords are pretty much useless, it needs to be more sophisticated. For example, right now I get this crap

>>> words=['blocked', 'censored', 'inaccessible']
>>> with tweetstream.FilterStream("SSL_CU_test_t", "733Tspeak", track=words, follow=None, locations=None) as stream:
...     for tweet in stream:
...         print tweet["user"]["screen_name"] + " wrote: " + tweet["text"]

2) We add a heuristic. Does the text contain a website?

Problem. If we fetch data from twitter stream then all the links get shortened to a t.co
This is built into twitter as it allows them to keep tweets within the word limit.

For ex,

>>> words = ['available', 'check it out']
>>> with tweetstream.FilterStream("SSL_CU_test_t", "733Tspeak", track=words) as stream:
...     for tweet in stream:
...         urls = [x[1]+x[2] for x in [urlparse(tweet_part) for tweet_part in tweet["text"].split(' ')] if x[1] != '']
...         if urls == []:
...             continue
...         print str(urls)
... 
[u't.co/b7BQuGD3']
[u't.co/YR2kA6oS\nLove', u't.co/ZltSpV9E']
[u't.co/XhM3JKk8']
[u't.co/7ycPhrLZ']
[u't.co/CHbbx9G6', u't.co/CHbbx9G6']
[u't.co/t9BOdEkK']

(No we cannot crawl twitter manually, a lot of parallel requests coming from a single server will alert twitter and our server will promptly get banned)

3) >>> words = ["blocked", "censored", "unavailable", "can't get to"]
>>> with tweetstream.FilterStream("SSL_CU_test_t", "733Tspeak", track=words) as stream:
...     for tweet in stream:
...         urls = [x[1]+x[2] for x in [urlparse(tweet_part) for tweet_part in tweet["text"].split(' ')] if x[1] != '']
...         if urls == []:
...             continue
...         for url in urls:
...             try:
...                 urllib2.urlopen('http://' + url).url
...             except:

The resolving process might lead to errors which may be because those websites are blocked in whichever country the stream crawler resides in.

One way of determining this is to try routing our requests through an external proxy and then verifying if the resolved URL is in the local herdict database.
But we may also get multiple links to the same website. What do we do in this case? If the tweets originate from a different user, it seems that we should update the herdict unavailable count even if the fact
that it is unavailable was not reported through the browser plugin.
Apart from this, for performance benefits, we should keep a cache that will store the last 20-25 urls. If the incoming url resides in there, we don't bother going to the db. This will reduce the number of
db calls in the presence of identical urls.

4) Word selection needs to be more careful as we need to take care of context. Words that indicate
some sort of outage or lack of service could mean something else entirely in a different context.

This does not work. We can't just add words to a wordlist and hope that it will give us what we want.
This raises the question of whether we need to do some NLP for some heavy lifting. I think this is a
waste of time because tweets are only 140 characters in length. We can get by with some heuristics.


5) One would be keyword pairs. That is, if a particular keyword is present in a tweet, we ascertain if a
   given paired keyword is present as well. Is there a fine grained way of doing this?

   Possibly. We keep a tiered keyword list. If a high tier keyword appears then we parse it and give the
   output immediately. If a low tiered keyword appears, we will need to do some sort of analysis. What
   this analysis will be, I am not sure. One way would be to have another associative keyword list (AKL)
   for each of the keywords in the low tiered list. So an AKL for "down", a low tiered word, could be;
   ["website", "url", "domain", "webpage"].

   The lesson to take home is that the algorithm does NOT matter, since the input size is always
   constant. All we need to do is to ensure that whatever analysis we do, will terminate in a bounded
   time period.

6) "Is Facebook down for you"
   
   To get stuff like this to work, what we need to do is use some sort of a noun identifier. Something
   like opencalais will do perfectly.

7) Why can't we use hash-tags. People aren't dumb. For example:

effective way of crowdsourcing relevant news stories related to specific topics.

Looked up tagwalk. Interesting website but it doesn't really harvest any links. 

We will need to use some combination of proper hashtags and keywords. This will require a lot of trial
and error sort of work.

8) Google charts demo

Using pygoogle-charts is simple enough. I just got time to experiment with the pie chart. Later on, it
would be fun to check out the other visualization tools.
